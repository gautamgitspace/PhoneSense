PhoneSense
==========

A sensing framework for mobile devices.

This project was developed as part of the CSE534:Advanced Mobile Computing Course at [IIIT-Delhi] (http://www.iiitd.ac.in).

This is a phone sensing platform currently available for Android as a library. This makes making applications for 
sensing data from mobile phones far cleaner and simpler than the native android library. There is also a 
server for collecting this information developed in Django.
